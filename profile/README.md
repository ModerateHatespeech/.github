## ModerateHatespeech
We empower communities with state-of-the-art solutions that help fight hate and foster more inclusive communities online. Our flagship, machine learning API helps manage communities spanning hundreds of millions of people, providing real-time insight into toxicity, and hate online. 

We work directly with community leaders, through programs like our [SAT Initative](https://moderatehatespeech.com/research/subreddit-program/), building tailored solutions through feedback and collaboration.

We seek to better understand hate speech on a global scale, through research and data like our [Twitter Toxicity Index](https://moderatehatespeech.com/research/twitter-toxicity-index/) and [database](https://moderatehatespeech.com/research/twitter-toxicity-index/search).

Visit our [website](http://moderatehatespeech.com/) or take a look at our [work](https://moderatehatespeech.com/research/) to learn more. Interested in implementing our API?
